# OpenSDS Mini-Summit Copenhagen 2018

The OpenSDS team held a
[Mini-Summit](https://events.linuxfoundation.org/events/kubecon-cloudnativecon-europe-2018/co-located-events/opensds-mini-summit/)
before CloudNativeCon/Kubecon EU held on May 2, 2018.

To help encourage participation in the project, I thought it would be a good
idea to provide an overview of the contribution workflow to the OpenSDS repos.
