# OpenStack Project Team Gathering, Denver 2018

In a year of returning to places, the OpenStack PTG returned to Denver, Co,
September 10-14, 2018.

Most of the week was design discussions and other sessions, but I did have one
presentation as part of the lunch time updates.

We were supposed to provide an overview of the Release Team during one of these
at the Dublin PTG, but due to the unusual amount of snow they received that
week, plans changed and we had to cancel.

The goal of this presentation was to provide an overview of what the team does,
why it's needed, and what we do to try to help teams with releasing their
projects.
