# OpenStack Summit and Forum, Berlin 2018

The second OpenStack Summit for 2018 was held in Berlin, Germany,
November 12 - 15.

Along with the normal Forum session participation, I was able to
[moderate and present](

a couple sessions. The Release Team Onboarding session is part of a series of
these kinds of sessions aimed at helping new contributors to learn about the
different projects and how to get involved.

The Etherpads with notes and links for the Forum sessions can be found in the
[list of Etherpads](https://wiki.openstack.org/wiki/Forum/Berlin2018) from the
event.
